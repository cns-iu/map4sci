## myAURA: Personalized Web Service for Epilepsy Management

<div class="visualizer-anchor"></div>

### About

The NIH-funded MyAura project will integrate location- and patient-specific health-care information with scientific literature, biomedical databases, social media, and epilepsy-related websites. This prototype interface lets users interactively explore information about clinical trials, drugs, and diseases. The user interface is driven by an epilepsy knowledge graph that integrates large-scale datasets and multi-level visualization algorithms that automatically extract backbones of the knowledge graph to ease data exploration.
